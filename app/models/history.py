# A lightweight summary of a chat session â€“ useful for populating a sidebar
# with the list of conversations without downloading the full history of every
# session. It only contains the identifier of the session, the content of the
# most recent message in that session (could be user or assistant), and the
# timestamp of that message so that the client can order sessions
# chronologically.
